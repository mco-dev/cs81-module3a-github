What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?
I learned that GitHub is a very smart way to document your progress with any project. It is also a great way to allow for others to give their input and help build your project with assistance from the community. It's a journal on a website. Having a "paper-trail" is very helpful when you need to hunt bugs while developing systems.

What was most confusing or frustrating?
The thing that is most confisung to me is trying to download someone elses project. I still have a hard time figuring out how to build from source. It is nice that the code is available for review so you know exactly what you are getting, but I still get lost when viewing another person's project page. The steps are straightforward for the most part. I did not run into any speed bumps.

Why do you think developers use Git?
Developes use Git because it keeps everything organized and documented. It's a one-stop-shop for projects. You can share your progress with others as well as allow them to contribute. You may also keep everything private.

How might this help with larger projects in the future?
I think that using Git and GitHub will help with larger projects because it helps to maintain order and organization. It is always helpful to know exactly who changed what and when it was changed. It is a method of backing up in the case a recovery is needed. It is also a way to hold accountability and see where the contributions are coming from.
